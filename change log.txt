Catechis 1.3  'Sebastien' 2013
==============================
* finished category management and other additions.

Catechis 1.2  'Antonine' 2012
=============================
* Added Category objects that can be managed by id, with exclusive an non-exclusive categories (not used in the web app yet)
* Sorted the WeeklyReports.

Catechis 1.1  "Moudon" 2011
===========================
* exclude characters fix
* add the users checked to the class.
* add new folder to in FUT to hold the weekly reports.  File name will be year-month-week: like 2011-10
* check for a week passed at login, and save a weekly session report, including putting the methods in ftr.
* save the current status, as well as words at which level in a daily status record
* figure out the average time a user takes on in each session/words tested.
This is just a partial list of from done items on our to do list.  Other items from indoct are not included here.
We started using status.record to hold a snapshot of activities, and the word stats are now updated after each test and the values are always up to date.
There is still some differences when the recalculate method is called, but that's something to fix in 1.2.
There is more, but who's going to read this anyway?  What we really need to do is keep a solid to do list, and keep track of done items better to be added to the change log after update.

Catechis 0.9 - 2009
===================
- Created utilities to retire words so that they will be excluded from the daily tests in FileJDOMWordLists.
- Retired words are also excluded from the DailyTestAction in WordLastTestDates.
- Created a utility to ad ids to any words that don't have them.
- Created FormatPanel to judge pixel length of strings so that we can create
lists of rows that will be printed in a table cell to aid in formatting lists
as a single page format, flash cards, etc.
- WordLastTestDates now allows setting a mark of i, j used in getList to save the
 daily_test_index in format i:j in the vocab/test.records file and using the mark later
  so that after the daliy_test_limit in user.options file is reached, we continue
  where we were last time, looking at words to test/exclude from testing. (Jan 13th, 08)
- New User creation routines are in FileUserUtilities in the admin package.
In admin.FileUserUtilities, the createNewUser method creates all the files and folders needed,
as well as the entry in the user.passes file.
- Also in FileUserUtilities is a method checkInvitationCode to see if the user knows the
contents of the <invitation_code> tag in the user.passes file to authenticate the
creation of a new user profile.
- Finally made a primary key id generator in Domartin, so users now have an id.

- Created import methods to import a list of words at one time.

  user options, putting a log entry in a file upon user log in, and monitoring
  services for an admin.
- erase missed words list.
- correct undo to level up
- remove repeats from weekly list (put this in user opts)
- ignore [pron.] hints...

- Fixed edit and delete word methods in FileStorage.
- Added methods to get filtered results from the tests.records file, as well
ad alter them for the undo method in ChangeUpdateAction. (9/30/07)
- Created FileTestRecords to store and retrieve daily test records.  This will also retrieve
the last history file in the user_name.hist file. (9/02/07)
- Created Categories interface to retrieve an ordered list of categories by earliest date.
Instead of overcrowding the Storage interface, similar methods are found in Categories.
A new folder was made for interfaces, and a separate folder for file-specific objects.
This was done to limit the number of java files crowding the main catechis package. (7/30/07)

Catechis 0.6 - Finished June 28th 2007
=====================================

- New Scoring utility that allows threadsafe access to take an AllWordsTest object 
and return a WordTestResult object. Finally finished June 28th although it was mostly 
complete months before this, but not debugged.

- Exclude words based on a last test date vector. May 2007.

- created a legacy package to use CreateJDOMList for test scoring and to get words
with recently tested words excluded. May 2007.

Catechis 0.5 - Finished April 15th, 2006
========================================

- Created Rate Of Forgetting utilities to calculate the period of time between when a user passes a test on a word,
and then fails a test a the next higher level.  This is to help create a schedule of words to be tested 
and reminders for when a word is being forgotten.

- Created WordTestDates to hold the list of words last test dates.  There are two separate lists for reading and writing,
and a separate ArrayList of milliseconds is kept so that the lists can be sorted by date.

- Fixed word level change error where a level 1 or higher test level could not be reversed correctly.

- Possible OutOfMemory error with the StatsTest.testAllWords method.


Catechis 0.4 - Finished Novemeber 2005
======================================

- Added update methods for changing a words text and definition as well as updating the test score to be used after a word test is run, and the user wants to reverse the result, on a word by word basis, becasue there is a typo in the original or answer, or as in a reading test, there is a one to many relationship in the words meaning.
- Added filter object and filtering mechanism based on it to do such things as exclude words based on an exclude time to filter out recently tested words.  As well as the old word level filters

a desktop app, webb app with struts, or any other architecture.
- Started using JUnit to test most methods.
